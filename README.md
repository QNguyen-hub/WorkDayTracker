This week assignment is to create a work day scheduler that is dynamic and change color of the text area base on the time of day.

The text area will be save to local storage and will be availabe after refreshing the page.

The toughest part is how to iterate throught the time block in the html file.

I went with each individual block instead to get the correct color to appear in the text block

currently I am running into how getting each one to save to localstorage.
